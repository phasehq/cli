    Secret Referencing Syntax:

    This documentation explains the syntax used for referencing secrets within the configuration. 
    Secrets can be referenced both locally (within the same environment) and across different environments, 
    with or without specifying a path.

    Syntax Patterns:

    1. Local Reference (Root Path):
        Syntax: `${KEY}`
        - Environment: Same as the current environment.
        - Path: Root path (`/`).
        - Secret Key: `KEY`
        - Description: References a secret named `KEY` in the root path of the current environment.

    2. Cross-Environment Reference (Root Path):
        Syntax: `${staging.DEBUG}`
        - Environment: Different environment (e.g., `dev`).
        - Path: Root path (`/`) of the specified environment.
        - Secret Key: `DEBUG`
        - Description: References a secret named `DEBUG` in the root path of the `staging` environment.

    3. Cross-Environment Reference (Specific Path):
        Syntax: `${prod./frontend/SECRET_KEY}`
        - Environment: Different environment (e.g., `prod`).
        - Path: Specifies a path within the environment (`/frontend/`).
        - Secret Key: `SECRET_KEY`
        - Description: References a secret named `SECRET_KEY` located at `/frontend/` in the `prod` environment.

    4. Local Reference (Specified Path):
        Syntax: `${/backend/payments/STRIPE_KEY}`
        - Environment: Same as the current environment.
        - Path: Specifies a path within the environment (`/backend/payments/`).
        - Secret Key: `STRIPE_KEY`
        - Description: References a secret named `STRIPE_KEY` located at `/backend/payments/` in the current environment.

    Note:
    The syntax allows for flexible secret management, enabling both straightforward local references and more complex cross-environment references.

    """
    Resolves a single secret reference to its actual value by fetching it from the specified environment.
    
    The function supports both local and cross-environment secret references, allowing for flexible secret management.
    Local references are identified by the absence of a dot '.' in the reference string, implying the current environment.
    Cross-environment references include an environment name, separated by a dot from the rest of the path.
    
    Args:
        ref (str): The secret reference string, which could be a local or cross-environment reference.
        current_env_name (str): The current environment name, used for resolving local references.
        phase ('Phase'): An instance of the Phase class to fetch secrets.
        
    Returns:
        str: The resolved secret value.
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the current environment name is not provided, or the secret is not found.
