    Secret Referencing Syntax:

    This documentation explains the syntax used for referencing secrets within the configuration. 
    Secrets can be referenced locally (within the same environment), across different environments, 
    and across different applications, with or without specifying a path.

    Syntax Patterns:

    1. Local Reference (Root Path):
        Syntax: `${KEY}`
        - Environment: Same as the current environment.
        - Path: Root path (`/`).
        - Secret Key: `KEY`
        - Description: References a secret named `KEY` in the root path of the current environment.

    2. Cross-Environment Reference (Root Path):
        Syntax: `${staging.DEBUG}`
        - Environment: Different environment (e.g., `staging`).
        - Path: Root path (`/`) of the specified environment.
        - Secret Key: `DEBUG`
        - Description: References a secret named `DEBUG` in the root path of the `staging` environment.

    3. Cross-Environment Reference (Specific Path):
        Syntax: `${prod./frontend/SECRET_KEY}`
        - Environment: Different environment (e.g., `prod`).
        - Path: Specifies a path within the environment (`/frontend/`).
        - Secret Key: `SECRET_KEY`
        - Description: References a secret named `SECRET_KEY` located at `/frontend/` in the `prod` environment.

    4. Local Reference (Specified Path):
        Syntax: `${/backend/payments/STRIPE_KEY}`
        - Environment: Same as the current environment.
        - Path: Specifies a path within the environment (`/backend/payments/`).
        - Secret Key: `STRIPE_KEY`
        - Description: References a secret named `STRIPE_KEY` located at `/backend/payments/` in the current environment.

    5. Cross-Application Reference:
        Syntax: `${backend_api::production./frontend/SECRET_KEY}`
        - Application: Different application (e.g., `backend_api`).
        - Environment: Different environment (e.g., `production`).
        - Path: Specifies a path within the environment (`/frontend/`).
        - Secret Key: `SECRET_KEY`
        - Description: References a secret named `SECRET_KEY` located at `/frontend/` in the `production` environment of the `backend_api` application.

    Note:
    The syntax allows for flexible secret management, enabling local references, cross-environment references, and cross-application references.

    Caching:
    - To improve performance and avoid N x 2 network requests when resolving references, secrets are cached in-memory
    - `resolve_all_secrets` first seeds the cache from `all_secrets` and prefetches all combos
      required by the references found in `value` by calling `phase.get()` without keys.
    - `resolve_secret_reference` checks the provided `secrets_dict` for secrets,
      falls back to the cache, and returns the unresolved placeholder if still not found.
    - The cache is process-local and not persisted or invalidated; it only reduces repeated
      lookups within a single execution.
